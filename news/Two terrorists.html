<br>
<br><h3>According to news agency ANI, at least two terrorists are holed in a house which has been surrounded by the security forces.
<br> The operation began following specific intelligence inputs about the presence of terrorists in the area. 
<br>
Though no loss of lives has been reported so far, one soldier has sustained injuries in the ongoing anti-terror operation. <br><br>

The security forces had launched a cordon and search operation in Larnoo village after receiving information about the presence of militants in the area.<br><br>

"As the cordon was tightened, the terrorists fired at the security forces. The injured soldier was immediately shifted to a hospital. Two to three terrorists are believed to be hiding inside a residential house in the area under cordon," the police added.<br><br>
<br><br>
In an encounter on October 19, the security forces killed three terrorists in Baramullaâ€™s Boniyar in Jammu and Kashmir.<br><br>
The deal to buy T-14 Armata FRCVs, if negotiated properly and finalised in the later stages, is likely to further cement the strategic bilateral partnership between the two countries.<br><br>

Shedding more light on Army Chief's 6-day visit, Col Aman Anand, PRO Indian Army, said, ''General Bipin Rawat is visiting Russia from October 1-6 an official bilateral visit. During the visit, the Chief of the Army Staff-led delegation is scheduled to meet Senior Military hierarchy of Russian Armed Forces and visit Key Military formations and establishments.''<br><br>

''General Bipin Rawat shall be visiting Mikhailovskaya Artillery Academy, Headquarters of Western Military District at St Petersburg and General Staff Academy and Headquarters of a Motorised Rifle Division at Moscow,'' the statement said.<br><br>

Interestingly, the Gen Rawat's visit also coincides with a bilateral annual summit being organised on October 5 in New Delhi during which defence deals worth over USD 10 billion are likely to be signed.<br><br>

The T-14 Armata FRCVs are likely to figure in the discussions as the Indian military delegation led by General Rawat meets the top brass of the Russian Armed Forces and key military formations and establishments. <br><br>

The procurement process for FRCVs was initiated by the Indian Army in November 2017 as part of a plan to induct hundreds of armoured vehicles similar to the Russian T-14 Armata, Ukrainian Oplot, and South Korean K2 Black Panther main battle tanks.<br><br>

According to the proposed procurement plan, the FRCVs will be manufactured in India by a private company in collaboration with the overseas original equipment manufacturer.<br><br>

General Rawat is also likely to discuss the maintenance and life-cycle support of Russian-made military platforms in India. <br><br>

The Indian Army has expressed hope that Gen Rawat's Russia visit will take forward the military to military cooperation to the next level.<br><br>

"The visit is yet another milestone in giving impetus to the strategic partnership between India and Russia and taking forward the military to military cooperation to the next level," it said. </h3>
